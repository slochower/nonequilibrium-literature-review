Brown and Sivak conclude that minimizing the depth (and number, I think) of intermediate metastable states maximizes the flux.

Their model defines forward and reverse rate constants similar to our model, although they deal with the input energy in a somewhat different manner. In our case, nonequilibrium populations drive the system. Here, the energy difference between the initial and final state of the system drive the population (see figure @fig:1). 


The forward rate constants from state $i$ to $j$ are $k^{+}_{ij}$ and these are reversible transitions. The is $k^{+}_{ij} P_{i}$, where $P_{i}$ is the probability in bin (or state) $i$. There is a total free energy budget $\sigma_\text{tot}$ that describes the free energy difference across the cycle. This seems a little strange to me, but perhaps this is the same as saying the free energy from ATP hydrolysis is what drives each cycle.

A corollary of their central claim is that when barriers are lower, transitions are faster, and flux increases. The authors also claim that flux is maximized by reducing the number of metastable states, i.e., turning a three state system into a two state system.
