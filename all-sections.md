## Theory

Theory text with a citation [@1DCUa6egE] with an equation $E = mc^{2}$.

These authors claim that maximizing the flux results in minimizes the free energy wells of intermediate metastable states. 

The forward rate constants from state $i$ to $j$ are $k\_{ij}$ and these are reversible transitions. The rate is $k^{+}\_{ij} P\_{i}$, where $P\_{i}$ is the probability in bin (or state) $i$. There is a total free energy budget $\sigma_\text{tot}$ that describes the free energy difference across the cycle.
